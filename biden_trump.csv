That’s the very core of my immigration policy. We can secure our borders without treating immigrants as less than human. My Administration will treat asylum seekers at our border with dignity and ensure that they receive the fair, legal hearing to which they are entitled.

Just a few days after Election Day next week, the Supreme Court will hear the case on the Affordable Care Act. While panicked and erratic in mishandling the pandemic, Donald Trump has been crystal clear on one thing — for the past four years, and again just last night on 60 Minutes — he wants to tear down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety and take away your health care and protections for pre-existing conditions.
This goal — the goal of the Republican Party for ten years — was a litmus test in selecting this nominee, regardless of the damage done to the U.S. Senate, to Americans’ faith in the legitimacy of the Supreme Court, and to our democracy, and regardless of how the Affordable Care Act has protected hundreds of millions of people before and during the pandemic.
But we will not give up. If you want to protect your health care, if you want your voice to be heard in Washington, if you want to say no, this abuse of power doesn’t represent you — then turn out and vote.
Vote for a president, for Members of Congress, and candidates up and down the ticket who actually have a plan for health care, and who will build on the Affordable Care Act to expand coverage, bring down costs, and give you more choices.
Vote to protect the fundamental idea that health care is a right, not a privilege.
And vote for the legacy of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She was proof that courage, conviction, and moral clarity can change not just the law, but also the world. Let us continue to be voices for justice in her name.

Eleven innocent lives were taken that Shabbat morning, ripped away from their families by a lone gunman taking longtime forces of bigotry and prejudice to their violent conclusion. This act of terror was not only an assault against the Jewish community of Pittsburgh — it was a strike against the soul of our nation and the values for which America stands.
Today, the pain remains. For the families of Tree of Life, New Light, and Dor Hadash, the grief will never fully subside. In the two years since, we have witnessed the courage and resilience of these congregations — responding to their most profound moment of fear and despair with purpose, compassion, and love.
When anti-Semitism is allowed to fester, it shreds the fabric of our communities and erodes our soul. We must stand up and speak out whenever and wherever it rears its head, because silence can become complicity. If we are ever to reach our full potential as a nation, we must banish hatred, bigotry, and conspiratorial fanaticism to the dustbin of history — and choose a path of dignity and respect for all people. 
On behalf of Jill, Kamala, Doug, and our families, we stand with the people of Squirrel Hill, the entire Pittsburgh community, and all Jewish Americans on this solemn anniversary.

It makes the shock and grief and violence of yesterday’s shooting that much more painful, especially for a community that has already endured so much trauma. Walter Wallace’s life, like too many others’, was a Black life that mattered — to his mother, to his family, to his community, to all of us. 
At the same time, no amount of anger at the very real injustices in our society excuses violence. Attacking police officers and vandalizing small businesses, which are already struggling during a pandemic, does not bend the moral arc of the universe closer to justice. It hurts our fellow citizens. Looting is not a protest, it is a crime. It draws attention away from the real tragedy of a life cut short. As a nation, we are strong enough to both meet the challenges of real police reform, including implementing a national use of force standard, and to maintain peace and security in our communities. That must be our American mission. That is how we will deliver real justice. All Donald Trump does is fan the flames of division in our society. He is incapable of doing the real work to bring people together. We will.

10/29/2020,biden,"Latinas are the hearts of their families and communities. So often, they’re the main breadwinners and the caregivers, too. Our economy does not work without them – but for too long, they have been underpaid and undervalued. On Latina Equal Pay Day, we call attention to the fact that Latinas make only 54 cents on the dollar compared to the average, non-Hispanic white man. That means they’ll lose over $1 million over their lifetime in comparison. It’s wrong. 
And now, President Trump’s failed response to this pandemic has plunged our nation not just into a recession, but into a “she-cession” – with millions of women, particularly Latinas and women of color, bearing the brunt of lost hours, lost wages, lost businesses, and lost jobs. Millions of Latinas are still out of work or have dropped out of the labor force completely since COVID-19 hit.
Our country can’t afford another four years of Donald Trump. Latinas know they deserve better – and that is why they are mobilizing, voting, and making sure their friends and family turn out at the polls. Latinas are demanding an equal shot at opportunity and prosperity, and a fairer, more inclusive future for their families.
As President, I’ll work for them every day. That starts with containing this virus—which has so disproportionately hit the Latino community—so we can get our lives back. And I’ll make sure we don’t just rebuild; we’ll build back better, closing the gender wage gap and fighting wage discrimination, so that Latinas — and all women — are paid equally for equal work. I’ll also fight to pass a $15 federal minimum wage; make it easier for workers to organize and bargain collectively; and break down barriers to higher paying jobs, including by boosting training and education opportunities and providing paid family leave, affordable child care, and affordable health care.
The economic challenges facing Latinas have been ignored and worsened by President Trump. A Biden-Harris Administration will build back better for them and their families, starting from day one.",,"36,155","2,576","6,100",post,"no pictures, just post",11:30 AM,10/31/2020,,,,en,

More than 228,000 Americans have lost their lives. It is as severe an indictment of a president's record as one can possibly imagine, and it is utterly disqualifying. Anyone who is responsible for plunging and ensnaring America in this crisis — anyone who could do so without an ounce of shame or a shred of empathy — should not be president. 
As deeply worrying as the trendlines are right now across the country, the terrifying truth is that the situation could get still markedly worse for Americans, as Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans move within striking distance of destroying the Affordable Care Act once and for all.  
But they underestimate the American people. For more than eight months, in the absence of any leadership from Trump, the American people have stepped up to care and look out for one another, as nurses and fire-fighters, doctors and police officers, farmworkers and grocers, researchers and community volunteers. All doing for our country what our president could not, did not, and would not. As we square our shoulders, facing into the headwinds of a challenging winter, we will do what America has always done — come together and meet the challenge with compassion, courage, determination and with a president who will always be in their corner, instead of turning his back.",,"50,742","4,857","12,000",post,"no pictures, just post",5:45 PM,11/1/2020,,,,en,

11/11/2020,biden,"Today, we as a nation pause to honor the service, the valor, and the commitment of all those who have worn the uniform of the Armed Forces of the United States. They stand as part of a proud chain of warrior patriots reaching back to the earliest days of our republic, each one taking up the sacred mission to defend our nation’s highest values, our liberty, and democracy. The women and men who have fought and sacrificed for our country are heroes, and the rest of us owe them an unpayable debt. They have earned our thanks and, above all, our respect.
For many years, I have said that we as a nation have many obligations, but we have only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare and equip our troops we send into harm’s way, and to care for them and their families when they return home. For our veterans, that means providing a future of security, opportunity, and dignity; world class health care provided by the VA, with women and LGBTQ+ veterans receiving culturally competent care; and addressing the mental health crises and epidemic of suicide that are claiming too many of our veterans and service members. We have to make clear to everyone suffering from unseen wounds that there is honor and strength in reaching out for help. And we have to make sure that no veteran is locked out of treatment for conditions related to toxic exposures or traumatic brain injuries experienced in the line of duty. Fulfilling our promises to our veterans and military families, caregivers, and survivors is critical to our national security, because it is how we will ensure that future generations continue to volunteer to serve.
For the Biden family, this is also a personal commitment. We learned what it really means to be part of a military family the year that Beau deployed to Iraq with his National Guard unit. We prayed every night and morning for his safety, and we missed him at every family gathering or when tucking his children in at night. It was hard. It hurt. These are challenges most American families never have to face. And yet, Jill and I were constantly in awe when visiting with wounded service members at Christmas or hosting veterans in our home for dinners, at the pride our military members and veterans feel in their service, and at their matchless sense of duty. They are the absolute best of our country.
This Veterans Day, I feel the full weight of the honor and the responsibility that has been entrusted to me by the American people as the next president, and I vow to honor our country’s sacred obligation. To all of our proud veterans, know that I will be a commander in chief who respects your sacrifice, understands your service, and who will never betray the values you fought so bravely to defend. I will never treat you or your families with anything less than the honor you deserve.

11/25/2020,biden,"Violence against women and girls is a global epidemic, affecting millions. As many as 1 in 3 women is the victim of gender-based violence at some point in her life, and that rate is even higher for women of color, lesbian and bisexual women, transgender individuals, and other members of vulnerable or underserved communities. This year, the COVID-19 pandemic has made matters worse, creating a “shadow pandemic” for many women and girls who are largely confined to their home with their abuser and facing economic insecurity that makes escape more difficult.
Today, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, I reaffirm my commitment to restore U.S. leadership in confronting this global scourge — and that starts right here at home. Writing and passing the Violence Against Women Act as a United States Senator remains one of my proudest legislative achievements. As vice president, I worked to end the culture of sexual assault and silence in this country by strengthening Title IX protections for students and creating the ""It's On Us"" program to help empower people to intervene to prevent sexual assault. As president, the vice president and I will work with the Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. We will also address the growing rates of domestic violence and sexual assault during the COVID-19 crisis and restore Title IX protections for student survivors of sexual assault, stalking, and dating violence. 
Our administration will renew the power of our example overseas and rejoin global efforts to confront gender-based violence in all its forms. We will ensure that women and girls fleeing gender-based violence in other parts of the world can seek asylum here and that visas are available to protect survivors who are not U.S. citizens. And as commander-in-chief, I will make it a priority at the highest levels to end the scourge of sexual violence and harassment against women service members.

That means providing access to high-quality, affordable health care, protecting and strengthening economic security for Americans with disabilities, and ensuring that students with disabilities have the resources necessary to mitigate the significant effects this pandemic has had on their education. We must ensure that people of color with disabilities have a fair shot and are treated equally.  And, as the global pandemic underscores how connected we are to communities across the globe, we must also recognize the ways we can champion and promote inclusion and accessibility for people with disabilities everywhere. 
On this day and every day of our administration, we will be fully committed to dignity, equity, and civil rights for all people with disabilities — who will have a voice and will be at the table in our administration for the critical work ahead.

12/10/2020,biden,"Seventy two years ago, Eleanor Roosevelt and other leaders from around the globe adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, affirming that all human beings are “born free and equal in dignity and rights.” From the horrors of a world war, they championed a simple yet revolutionary truth — that peace, prosperity, and justice rely on our obligation to uphold the universal rights of all. 
Today, we recognize Human Rights Day and honor those who work tirelessly, often at great personal risk, to defend fundamental freedoms and fight oppression. Around the world, authoritarian leaders desperate to maintain their grip on power deny this truth: internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms are each — equally — the entitlement of all. It makes no difference where we live and no matter how we look, how we pray, or whom we love. In too many countries, people are imprisoned and face torture or death for speaking their minds, reporting the news, or demanding their rights. 
This year, amid a pandemic and global protests, we are reminded of how much work remains to be done to root out the systemic inequities that continue to cut short lives and imperil livelihoods. And as we work with partners and through international organizations to advance human rights globally, we must also recognize that our task begins at home. Every American — regardless of race, ethnicity, zip code, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability — should be free to flourish in a society that values and defends equal justice for all. We must lead by the power of our example, standing in solidarity with generations of brave women and men who have fought for our common dignity.

12/12/2020,biden,"Five years ago today, the world gathered to adopt the Paris Agreement on climate change. The product of years of tough diplomacy, the Paris Agreement created an unprecedented framework for global action to avoid potentially catastrophic planetary warming, while building global resilience to the climate impacts we are already experiencing. It sent a clear signal that nearly 200 countries were — finally, together —moving toward a clean-energy future. 
U.S. leadership was essential to negotiating Paris and indispensable to bringing the Agreement into force. Over the last four years, however, the world has lost that momentum, and nations and people in every part of the world are feeling the devastating impacts of a changing climate. We haven’t come close to the bold action that’s needed, and today, we have no time to waste. 
The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one of my presidency, and I’ll immediately start working with my counterparts around the world to do all that we possibly can, including by convening the leaders of major economies for a climate summit within my first 100 days in office. The Biden-Harris Administration will increase the ambition of our domestic climate target and put the country on a sustainable path to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050. We’ll elevate the incredible work cities, states, and businesses have been doing to help reduce emissions and build a cleaner future. We’ll listen to and engage closely with the activists, including young people, who have continued to sound the alarm and demand change from those in power. And we’ll do all of this knowing that we have before us an enormous economic opportunity to create jobs and prosperity at home and export clean American-made products around the world, harnessing our climate ambition in a way that is good for American workers and the U.S. economy. 
As we mark this anniversary, I am grateful to leaders around the world and across the country — at all levels — who remained steadfast in their commitment to the goals we embraced five years ago in Paris.

He is a diehard globalist who cares nothing for working people. He repeatedly tried to cut Medicare & Social Security. Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA – sending your auto Jobs to Mexico. He voted for China’s entry into the World Trade Organization – gutting your industries to finance China’s rise. HALF of all Michigan auto manufacturing jobs were ELIMINATED after the Biden-Backed NAFTA and China Disasters. At every turn, Biden twisted his knife into the back of Michigan workers. In 2016, Michigan voted to FIRE this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as President who is finally putting AMERICA FIRST!

They just ignored that, ignored the Constitution. Now we bring it down to the counting houses, and outrageously, observers, who are the sentinels of integrity & transparency, were excluded. Pennsylvania has conducted itself in a horrible lawless way, and hopefully this will be corrected at the Supreme Court of the United States.
