"43",2020-10-22,"biden","Every day it seems we uncover new horrors perpetrated by President Trump and his administration against our most deeply held values in pursuit of their extreme anti-immigrant agenda. Of the thousands of children that the Trump Administration forcibly separated from their parents as part of its cruel “zero-tolerance” policy, 545 children are still separated from their parents years later. This Administration ripped babies from their mother’s arms, and then it seems, those parents were in many cases deported without their children and have not been found. It’s an outrage, a moral failing, and a stain on our national character. There are many issues that are complicated, but some things are just black and white. Families belong together. That’s the very core of my immigration policy. We can secure our borders without treating immigrants as less than human. My Administration will treat asylum seekers at our border with dignity and ensure that they receive the fair, legal hearing to which they are entitled. I’ll send a bill to Congress on day one that will create a roadmap to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented individuals already living in and strengthening the United States.

Just a few days after Election Day next week, the Supreme Court will hear the case on the Affordable Care Act. While panicked and erratic in mishandling the pandemic, Donald Trump has been crystal clear on one thing — for the past four years, and again just last night on 60 Minutes — he wants to tear down the Affordable Care Act in its entirety and take away your health care and protections for pre-existing conditions.
This goal — the goal of the Republican Party for ten years — was a litmus test in selecting this nominee, regardless of the damage done to the U.S. Senate, to Americans’ faith in the legitimacy of the Supreme Court, and to our democracy, and regardless of how the Affordable Care Act has protected hundreds of millions of people before and during the pandemic.
But we will not give up. If you want to protect your health care, if you want your voice to be heard in Washington, if you want to say no, this abuse of power doesn’t represent you — then turn out and vote.
Vote for a president, for Members of Congress, and candidates up and down the ticket who actually have a plan for health care, and who will build on the Affordable Care Act to expand coverage, bring down costs, and give you more choices.
Vote to protect the fundamental idea that health care is a right, not a privilege.
And vote for the legacy of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She was proof that courage, conviction, and moral clarity can change not just the law, but also the world. Let us continue to be voices for justice in her name.

"148",2020-10-27,"biden","Two years ago, a white supremacist entered Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue and perpetrated the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history. Eleven innocent lives were taken that Shabbat morning, ripped away from their families by a lone gunman taking longtime forces of bigotry and prejudice to their violent conclusion. This act of terror was not only an assault against the Jewish community of Pittsburgh — it was a strike against the soul of our nation and the values for which America stands.
Today, the pain remains. For the families of Tree of Life, New Light, and Dor Hadash, the grief will never fully subside. In the two years since, we have witnessed the courage and resilience of these congregations — responding to their most profound moment of fear and despair with purpose, compassion, and love.
When anti-Semitism is allowed to fester, it shreds the fabric of our communities and erodes our soul. We must stand up and speak out whenever and wherever it rears its head, because silence can become complicity. If we are ever to reach our full potential as a nation, we must banish hatred, bigotry, and conspiratorial fanaticism to the dustbin of history — and choose a path of dignity and respect for all people.

We cannot accept that in this country a mental health crisis ends in death. It makes the shock and grief and violence of yesterday’s shooting that much more painful, especially for a community that has already endured so much trauma. Walter Wallace’s life, like too many others’, was a Black life that mattered — to his mother, to his family, to his community, to all of us. 
At the same time, no amount of anger at the very real injustices in our society excuses violence. Attacking police officers and vandalizing small businesses, which are already struggling during a pandemic, does not bend the moral arc of the universe closer to justice. It hurts our fellow citizens. Looting is not a protest, it is a crime. It draws attention away from the real tragedy of a life cut short. As a nation, we are strong enough to both meet the challenges of real police reform, including implementing a national use of force standard, and to maintain peace and security in our communities. That must be our American mission. That is how we will deliver real justice. All Donald Trump does is fan the flames of division in our society. He is incapable of doing the real work to bring people together. We will.

"187",2020-10-29,"biden","Latinas are the hearts of their families and communities. So often, they’re the main breadwinners and the caregivers, too. Our economy does not work without them – but for too long, they have been underpaid and undervalued. On Latina Equal Pay Day, we call attention to the fact that Latinas make only 54 cents on the dollar compared to the average, non-Hispanic white man. That means they’ll lose over $1 million over their lifetime in comparison. It’s wrong. 
And now, President Trump’s failed response to this pandemic has plunged our nation not just into a recession, but into a “she-cession” – with millions of women, particularly Latinas and women of color, bearing the brunt of lost hours, lost wages, lost businesses, and lost jobs. Millions of Latinas are still out of work or have dropped out of the labor force completely since COVID-19 hit.
Our country can’t afford another four years of Donald Trump. Latinas know they deserve better – and that is why they are mobilizing, voting, and making sure their friends and family turn out at the polls. Latinas are demanding an equal shot at opportunity and prosperity, and a fairer, more inclusive future for their families.
As President, I’ll work for them every day. That starts with containing this virus—which has so disproportionately hit the Latino community—so we can get our lives back. And I’ll make sure we don’t just rebuild; we’ll build back better, closing the gender wage gap and fighting wage discrimination, so that Latinas — and all women — are paid equally for equal work. I’ll also fight to pass a $15 federal minimum wage; make it easier for workers to organize and bargain collectively; and break down barriers to higher paying jobs, including by boosting training and education opportunities and providing paid family leave, affordable child care, and affordable health care.
The economic challenges facing Latinas have been ignored and worsened by President Trump. A Biden-Harris Administration will build back better for them and their families, starting from day one.","no pictures, just post",36155,6100,2576,"post","en",NA

More than 228,000 Americans have lost their lives. It is as severe an indictment of a president's record as one can possibly imagine, and it is utterly disqualifying. Anyone who is responsible for plunging and ensnaring America in this crisis — anyone who could do so without an ounce of shame or a shred of empathy — should not be president. 
As deeply worrying as the trendlines are right now across the country, the terrifying truth is that the situation could get still markedly worse for Americans, as Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans move within striking distance of destroying the Affordable Care Act once and for all.  
But they underestimate the American people. For more than eight months, in the absence of any leadership from Trump, the American people have stepped up to care and look out for one another, as nurses and fire-fighters, doctors and police officers, farmworkers and grocers, researchers and community volunteers.

"333",2016-11-09,"Clinton","Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans.

This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for, and I’m sorry we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.

But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together—this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America, and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life.

I know how disappointed you feel, because I feel it too. And so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful, and it will be for a long time. But I want you to remember this: Our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love—and about building an America that’s hopeful, inclusive, and big-hearted.

We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America—and I always will. And if you do, too, then we must accept this result—and then look to the future.

Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.

Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power, and we don’t just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things—the rule of law, the principle that we’re all equal in rights and dignity, and the freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these things too—and we must defend them.

And let me add: Our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years, but all the time. So let’s do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear: making our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top; protecting our country and protecting our planet; and breaking down all the barriers that hold anyone back from achieving their dreams.

We’ve spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American Dream is big enough for everyone—for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities. Our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek. And I know you will. I am so grateful to stand with all of you.

I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey. It gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front-lines of our democracy, representing Virginia in the Senate.

To Barack and Michelle Obama: Our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude for your graceful, determined leadership, and so do I.

To Bill, Chelsea, Marc, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers, and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express.
You crisscrossed this country on my behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most—even 4-month-old Aidan traveling with his mom.

I will always be grateful to the creative, talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country who poured their hearts into this campaign. For you veterans, this was a campaign after a campaign — for some of you, this was your first campaign ever. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anyone has had.

To all the volunteers, community leaders, activists, and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook—even in secret or in private: Thank you.

To everyone who sent in contributions as small as $5 and kept us going, thank you.

And to all the young people in particular, I want you to hear this. I’ve spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I’ve had successes and I’ve had setbacks—sometimes really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too.

This loss hurts. But please, please never stop believing that fighting for what’s right is worth it. It’s always worth it. And we need you keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.

To all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion.

I know that we still have not shattered that highest glass ceiling. But some day someone will—hopefully sooner than we might think right now.

And to all the little girls watching right now, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world.

Finally, I am grateful to our country for all it has given me.
I count my blessings every day that I am an American. And I still believe, as deeply as I ever have, that if we stand together and work together, with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions, and love for this nation—our best days are still ahead of us.

You know I believe we are stronger together and will go forward together. And you should never be sorry that you fought for that.
Scripture tells us: “Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap, if we do not lose heart.”

My friends, let us have faith in each other. Let us not grow weary. Let us not lose heart. For there are more seasons to come and there is more work to do.

I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election. May God bless you and God bless the United States of America.",NA,781326,77732,150533,"status","en",NA

Thatâ€™s her North Star. Thatâ€™s what guides her. She believes in that. She believes we can summon whatâ€™s best in each of us and make this country better for all of us. 
 
 Thatâ€™s what America is about. We are a country like no other not because of the size of our skyscrapers or the power of our armies, but because we are a place founded for the sake of an idea. 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.' We donâ€™t have to be born into wealth or privilege in this country. We donâ€™t have to practice a certain faith. We donâ€™t have to have a certain last name. We just have to be willing to contribute. We just have to be willing to put our shoulder to the wheel of history, and we can be a part of this community that we call America. 
 
 Thatâ€™s what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny. Thatâ€™s what led GIs to liberate a continent. Thatâ€™s what gave women the courage to reach for the ballot. Thatâ€™s what gave marchers the courage to cross a bridge in Selma. Thatâ€™s what allowed workers to organize for collective bargaining and better wages. Thatâ€™s what made America exceptional. Thatâ€™s what makes America great. 
 
 In other words, America depends on youâ€”you, all of you. America has never been about what one person says heâ€™ll do for us. I didnâ€™t say 'Yes, I can.' I said, 'Yes, we can.' Itâ€™s about what can be achieved by us, each of us, together, through that hard, slow, and, yes, sometimes frustrating work of self-government.

"415",2016-11-04,"Clinton","""The good news is, all of you are uniquely qualified to make sure this guy who is uniquely unqualified does not become President. You just got to vote. You just got to vote. And the nice thing is, you don’t just have to vote against that guy because you’ve got a candidate who is actually worthy of your vote—who is smart, and who is steady, and who is tested, is probably the most qualified person ever to run for this office, and that is the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton.

Hillary, she just works through whatever is in front of her. She’s got grit and she’s got resilience. And if she gets knocked down, she just comes back up and she goes back at it. And she knows, most importantly, what the decisions that a President makes means to you.  

This isn’t abstract stuff we’re talking about here. If you’re a student, whether you get a Pell grant or were able to make sure that you don’t have a mountain of debt when you get out of school, that depends on decisions that are made in part by the President. If you’re a soldier, whether you get deployed to some far-off land, that is up to the Commander-in-Chief. If you’re a young person who was brought to this country as a child, has grown up as an American but maybe doesn’t have the papers and now you’re trying to figure out how you can contribute to this country you call home, that is something the President has influence over. Veterans, seniors, a single mom who needs some help with child care—that’s what these decisions are about. And Hillary understands that, and she knows those folks need a champion.

And she’s actually got plans to help. She’s actually got plans. The other guy is not a big plan guy. She’s got plans. She can show you how she’s going to make sure more people have early childhood education. She’s going to show how young people can have more affordable college education. And while she’s executing those plans, she’s also going to respect working Americans and the values we care about."" —President Obama",NA,31203,5681,3348,"photo","en",NA

""By now, you've probably heard some news about a bewildering letter sent to Congressional leaders by the Director of the FBI. This is all a bit confusing, and much of the reporting has been misleading or downright inaccurate, so I want to take a minute to walk through this. 

Here's the quick backstory: In July, FBI Director Jim Comey concluded a year-long investigation by deciding not to go forward with any case about Hillary's emails. It wasn't even a close call, he said. In his words, 'no reasonable prosecutor' would have brought charges.

Yesterday, in a surprise to us all, Comey wrote a very strange letter to Congress that was long on innuendo and short on facts. He said that in a completely separate investigation, the FBI had found some emails that may or may not be related to Hillary, and indeed may or may not be significant at all.

It's being reported that Comey sent this letter over the objections of Department of Justice officials who told him that it was inconsistent with longstanding policy of both Democratic and Republican administrations not to take action that might impact an election. It's an unprecedented intrusion into a close presidential election with less than 11 days until Election Day.
 
Voters deserve answers.

Comey needs to come clean with the American people about what he found and answer all the questions about why he took this unprecedented step less than weeks before the election.

Here's what this changes for you and this campaign: Absolutely nothing.

The facts be damned—Trump's always shown a complete disregard for the truth. In spite of there being no new information, he's already raising money off the bizarre letter (he literally sent a text message asking for money within an hour of the story breaking!) and he's more fired up than ever on the trail today.

These are the actions of a desperate man. Trump knows he can't win on his character, temperament, or his policies. He's behind, so he'll cling to whatever he can. We can't let him get away with this.

Our organizers and volunteers on the ground are rallying behind Hillary in what will be the biggest volunteer weekend of the campaign so far. You need to have her back, too. You need to say you're not willing to let Trump bully or buy his way into the presidency, and you're not going to let anything stop us from making history.

One day, I asked Wanda if everything was all right, and she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. I immediately told her she had to come live with us. I called my mother, and my mother said, “Of course she does.”
And so Wanda did.  
Wanda’s story is one of the reasons I wanted to become a prosecutor. As a courtroom prosecutor, I felt a deep sense of responsibility to take on crimes and harms against women and children. When I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim but in the name of the people for one simple reason: In our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us.
Through all my decades in law enforcement, I never asked a victim or a witness, “Are you a Republican or a Democrat?” The only question I ever asked was, “Are you okay?” That is the kind of president we deserve, and that is the kind of president I pledge to be.

For decades as a prosecutor and as the top law enforcement officer of our biggest state, I won fights against big banks that ripped off homeowners. Against for-profit colleges that scammed veterans and students. Against cartels that trafficked in guns, drugs, and human beings. And against predators who abused women and children. 
I did this work because for as long as I can remember, I have always had an instinct to protect. 
There’s just something about people being treated unfairly, or overlooked, that’s always gotten under my skin. 
It is what my mother instilled in me—a drive to hold accountable those who use their wealth or power to take advantage of people. To protect hard-working Americans who aren’t always seen or heard and deserve a voice.

I’ve lived the promise of America.
I saw how hard my mother worked to give her daughters the same chances this country gave her. I was blessed to have family by blood and family by love who instilled in me the values of community, compassion, and faith that have always defined our nation at our best.
I’ve lived the promise of America. 
I’ve spent my life fighting for people who have been overlooked, but who still believe that in this country, we should all be equal in the eyes of the law.
I’ve lived the promise of America—and I see the promise of America in all of you.
In the young people voting for the first time, who are determined to live free from gun violence, protect our planet, and shape the world they inherit. In the women who refuse to accept a future without reproductive freedom and the men who support them. In Republicans who have never voted for a Democrat before but put the Constitution of the United States over party.
In Americans, different in many respects, but united by love of freedom, a belief in fairness and decency, and faith in a better future.

"939",2024-11-06,"harris","My heart is full today—full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country, and full of resolve. 
The outcome of this election is not what we wanted or what we fought for, but hear me when I say: The light of America's promise will always burn bright—as long as we never give up, and as long as we keep fighting. 
Earlier today, I spoke with President Trump. I told him that we will help him and his team with the transition, and we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power. 
In our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or party, but to the Constitution of the United States, our conscience, and our God. My allegiance to all three is why, while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign: the fight for freedom, for opportunity, and for fairness and the dignity of all people.
That is a fight I will never give up.
I will never give up the fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams, ambitions, and aspirations; a future where women have the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies and not have their government telling them what to do; where we protect our schools and our streets from gun violence. 
We will never give up the fight for rule of law, equal justice, and for the sacred idea that every one of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld.
To the young people watching, it is okay to feel sad and disappointed. On the campaign, I would often say: When we fight, we win. Sometimes the fight takes a while, but that doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is to never stop trying to make the world a better place.
There is an adage: Only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time. For the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But, America, if it is: Let us fill the sky with the light of a billion brilliant stars.
May the light of optimism, faith, truth, and service guide us—even in the face of setbacks—toward the extraordinary promise of the United States of America.","photo of harris on podium",152263,37111,30499,"photo","en","yes"
