10/3/2024,harris,5400000,"On January 6, Donald Trump incited an attack on our nation’s democracy because he didn’t like the outcome of the election. Armed with weapons and animated by Trump’s lies, insurrectionists invaded the United States Capitol in an attempt to overturn a lawful election.
The January 6 Committee exemplified a bipartisan effort to safeguard our democracy and preserve our most sacred freedoms for generations to come—led by Republicans like Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger who chose to put country over party—alongside Democrats.
The oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States is sacred and must always be upheld—never violated. The most fundamental question in this election is: Who will obey that oath?
I have sworn that oath to uphold the Constitution six times throughout my career—not only as Vice President or as a U.S. Senator, but also as the top law enforcement officer of the largest state in our country. I have never wavered in upholding that oath, and I have always executed it faithfully and without reservation.
Therein lies the profound difference between Donald Trump and me.
Anyone who, like Donald Trump, violates that oath—who recklessly tramples on our democratic values, who actively tries to overturn the will of the American people, or who has called for the “termination” of the Constitution—must never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States.
The vast majority of us agree that upholding the Constitution must be a basic requirement we expect of anyone seeking the highest office in the land. Regardless of our political party, we believe that we must hold sacred America’s fundamental principles—from the rule of law to the peaceful transfer of power.
If you stand for country, democracy, and the rule of law—our campaign has a place for you.","references to Cheney, Jan 6 and democracy",14039,6101,3276,yes,photo,,10/5/2024,en

FEMA is reimbursing 100% of the local and state government costs.

Those were my first memories of seeing people fighting for the freedoms and the promise of America that had long been kept from them.
As I have traveled across the country, I have spoken with many Americans—including Black men—about their hopes, dreams, hurdles, and worries. Black men and boys deserve a president who sees them, and will help break through the barriers preventing them from building intergenerational wealth and realizing their aspirations.
Donald Trump is not that president.
Trump’s business career began when he was investigated for refusing to rent property to Black families. His entry into public life was when he took out a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for the execution of the Central Park Five—innocent Black teenagers who were later exonerated. As president, he called majority-Black nations “shitholes.”
Today, Trump’s Project 2025 agenda would give him unchecked power, posing an even more serious threat to Black communities. He would bring back stop-and-frisk, roll back civil and voting rights, and implement a national sales tax costing families an average of $4,000 per year.
We can’t go back—and we do not have to. Today, I’m announcing an Opportunity Agenda for Black Men.
It will, among other things, provide 1 million fully forgivable loans to entrepreneurs, and protect cryptocurrency investments so people who make them know their money is safe. It will launch a National Health Equity Initiative focused on illnesses that disproportionately impact Black men like sickle cell disease and diabetes. And it will legalize recreational marijuana and ensure that all Americans have opportunities to succeed as this new industry takes shape.

One day, I asked Wanda if everything was all right, and she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. I immediately told her she had to come live with us. I called my mother, and my mother said, “Of course she does.”
And so Wanda did.  
Wanda’s story is one of the reasons I wanted to become a prosecutor. As a courtroom prosecutor, I felt a deep sense of responsibility to take on crimes and harms against women and children. When I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim but in the name of the people for one simple reason: In our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us.
Through all my decades in law enforcement, I never asked a victim or a witness, “Are you a Republican or a Democrat?” The only question I ever asked was, “Are you okay?” That is the kind of president we deserve, and that is the kind of president I pledge to be.

11/06/2024,harris,5600000,"My heart is full today—full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country, and full of resolve. 
The outcome of this election is not what we wanted or what we fought for, but hear me when I say: The light of America's promise will always burn bright—as long as we never give up, and as long as we keep fighting. 
Earlier today, I spoke with President Trump. I told him that we will help him and his team with the transition, and we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power. 
In our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or party, but to the Constitution of the United States, our conscience, and our God. My allegiance to all three is why, while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign: the fight for freedom, for opportunity, and for fairness and the dignity of all people.
That is a fight I will never give up.
I will never give up the fight for a future where Americans can pursue their dreams, ambitions, and aspirations; a future where women have the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies and not have their government telling them what to do; where we protect our schools and our streets from gun violence. 
We will never give up the fight for rule of law, equal justice, and for the sacred idea that every one of us, no matter who we are or where we start out, has certain fundamental rights and freedoms that must be respected and upheld.
To the young people watching, it is okay to feel sad and disappointed. On the campaign, I would often say: When we fight, we win. Sometimes the fight takes a while, but that doesn't mean we won't win. The important thing is to never stop trying to make the world a better place.
There is an adage: Only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time. For the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But, America, if it is: Let us fill the sky with the light of a billion brilliant stars.
May the light of optimism, faith, truth, and service guide us—even in the face of setbacks—toward the extraordinary promise of the United States of America.",photo of harris on podium,152263,37111,30499,yes,photo,,5/14/2025,en
